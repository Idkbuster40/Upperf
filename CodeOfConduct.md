### Rules for committing/contributing:
If you are planning on committing or contributing to this repository please follow these rules: 

  0. The allowed languages are: Java and anything which works with JNI in a stable enough manner.
  
  1. No one can commit directly on the main/master branch. Or edit the README file without notifying me first.
       
  2. Use the `develop_<version_number>` branch for new changes to the software which has been approved after a PR between contributors.
     
  3. If you want to make a new change, you will create a new branch, for that specific feature/change. It should follow a naming scheme
  like: `VersionOfMC_TestingBuild_ExperimentalOrStable_YourName`, to give an example: `1122_alpha_experimental_ABC123`. Do note other contributors can see/change what you are doing. Keep this in mind. You are free to make a fork of this and work on it yourself and merge it back to your branch here if you feel others will tamper with what you have done.

  4. Use a TODO.md with a checklist of what you have implemented in your "personal" branch. A much more general checklist of features is in this README file.
     
  5. If it works after _through_ testing, the contributors will do a PR to the `develop_<version_number>` branch. We all can read it, and then merge it to the branch.
  
  6. For discussing stuff to do with the project, like errors or new ideas, use the GitHub Issues feature.
 
  7. PLEASE at least try to be a little sensible about commit names, like instead of "Fix weird rendering bug" please try to write "Fix rendering bug with anisotropic filtering". It does not strictly need to be like that, but you (hopefully) get the gist.
  
  8. When contributors have finished a major update, we will all agree to merge to the `major_develop_<version_number>` branch. Then from there we test it and build a shippable binary.
     
  9. If you end up having a personal vendetta with someone, please take it outside of this GitHub repository and refrain using the issues feature as a debate battlefield. Argue your personal differences outside of this repository. Refrain from being rude to one another and using offensive language in this repository. (I am iterating this once again, please understand what to do. Settle your differences outside of this repo. ...But this is the internet and people don't care. Well... Just listen to me please.)
  
  10. If you feel the rules are too strict, please try to abide by them, these rules are not constant and will change soon. And if you feel these rules are too confusing, try to break it down and understand it with your brain. (I don't mean to be too rude here, but understand this carefully.)

Please try to follow these rules and understand what you are doing.
