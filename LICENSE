I don't enjoy making this, but thanks to multiple controversies and drama in this community because of open-source software and proprietary software, I have to do this.
I also don't want to worry about legal stuff so I am making this license. Because this software is free and open source, I am keeping this license for the time being. I tried to make this align with Minecraft's EULA. 
You are free to use this license in your own projects if you don't largely modify it.
